<p>       
    I'm Sukesh Ramakrishna Pillai, an author. Some people out there know me as the founder of Love All Sports Academy and Books N Beyond Library. 
    Recently, people have been recognizing me as an author; to be very frank, I love that people call me "Ezhuthukaaran". 
  
</p>
<p>
    April 12, 2023, was a big day for me- the launch of my first book, "Pillayude Thallukal".
     After months of hard work, it was finally here, "Pillayude Thallukal".
      I've always loved books, and the thought of having one of my own out there in the world is both thrilling and daunting. It's a vulnerable thing to put your work out there, but I'm hopeful that readers will enjoy my "Thallukal" and find something in it that speaks to them. Pillayude Thallukal contains nine series with 27 chapters in each book. Not only 27 stories but also 27 caricatures are there. These 27 wonderful caricatures were drawn by Ratheesh, and I got a phenomenal cover page by Mansoor Cheruppa. I published "Pillayude Thallukal" under Olive Publications. DTP works of Pillayude Thallukal was done by Shanthini. These 27 stories truly happened in my life—27 true memories.

    The launch itself was a big event, and there were a lot of moving parts to manage. 
    There were the logistics of getting the book printed and distributed, organising a launch event, and promoting the book through social media, interviews, and other channels.
     But there was also the emotional side of things. Finalising the launch venue was one of the hardest parts. After going through tremendous formalities, we found a space in the Napier Museum in Trivandrum. 
    Misc Archive, Trivandrum, organised the event. They created a day that is both memorable and successful.

    On the launch day, the atmosphere was electric. Launch day was a culmination of all the hard work and dedication that went into writing the book, and it was a chance to celebrate with friends, family, and other supporters who helped make it possible. It was a time to reflect on the journey that led me here and to feel grateful for all the people who believed in me along the way. Of course, the launch was just the beginning. Now that the book is out there, it's up to readers to decide whether they like it or not. That's both scary and exciting - there's always a chance that the book won't find an audience, but there's also the possibility that it could connect with people in ways I never imagined. "Pillayude Thallukal" is a short story that can be read within one and a half hours. Writing a book is a challenging and rewarding process, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to share my work with the world. I hope that readers enjoy the book and that it brings a little bit of joy and inspiration into their lives. Apart from “Pillayude Thallukal” I got the chance to launch “Vanya Jeevikalude Athbhutha Lokham” a book written by my father, N Ramakrishna Pillai. For me, it was the best part. 
Pillayude Thallukal” was launched by Honourable Minister Saji Cheriyan, and it was received by Sri Madhupal (Actor). The E-book launch was done by Honourable MLA Sri V K Prasanth. Rather than that, there was an Audio-book launch by Sri G Venugopal (Playback singer). 
The event ends with a book signing, allowing readers to get a signed copy of the book “Pillayude Thallukal”. One of the most special moments in my life. A book launch day is a momentous occasion, marking the end of a journey and the beginning of a new chapter. It was a day of celebration, anticipation, and accomplishment. For me, it was a chance to share my story with the world and to connect with the readers. “Pillayude Thallukal” launch day was a celebration of the written word, a reminder of the power of storytelling, and a testament to the resilience and creativity of the human spirit.
